# 🛩️ Noel's Terraform Configuration
> *Terraform configuration for development of my projects.*

This is a repository of the Terraform configuration for applying the software I use when I develop my projects. I used to use Docker Compose but as the list grows, the more it was hard to maintain and to fix maintenance on. It uses the Docker [Terraform provider](https://github.com/kreuzwerker/terraform-provider-docker).

It is also to keep my Terraform configuration just in case I lose this while doing dumb stuff, I'm pretty clumsy. :(

## License
