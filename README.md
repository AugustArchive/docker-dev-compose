# Noel's Development Containers
> *Noel's development containers in a form of a Docker Compose project.*

This is a repository of the Docker Compose files I use when I am developing software that I open source on GitHub. Before Jan 16, 2023, I was using Terraform and for this... it has became a real pain to keep it working. So, I went back to Docker Compose.

I still do use Terraform as a form of developing my infrastructure, but only for infrastructure that is in production.
